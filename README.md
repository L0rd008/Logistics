# Logistics

- route_optimizer/ (Standalone service)
  - Inputs: delivery locations, vehicle capacities
  - Output: optimized delivery route
  - Purpose: The brain of the logistics module
  - Develop this first so you can test assignment logic early
 
- map_service/ (Optional)
  - Utility/service to fetch real-world distances
  - Can be a local function or API-based (OpenRouteService / OpenStreetMap)
  - Can be skipped initially, use dummy distance matrix
 
- fleet/ (Django app)
  - Models: Vehicle, Status, Capacity, Location
  - REST APIs to get available vehicles, update location/status
  - You’ll need this to match vehicles with optimized route
 
- assignment/ (Django app)
  - Inputs: optimized route + available vehicles (from fleet)
  - Logic: assign deliveries to vehicle
  - Output: assignment events, persisted records
  - Triggers optimizer and manages dispatching
 
- scheduler/ (Lambda or Celery)
  - Automatically triggers assignment + route_optimizer daily/hourly
  - Optional for early dev, but crucial for automation
 
- monitoring/ (Django app)
  - Captures logs, alerts, failed deliveries, delays
  - Optional dashboard with charts and status
  - Could connect with Kafka or DB log events from assignment
- shipments/ (Django app) 
  - Models: Shipment (order_id, origin, destination, status)
  - Status Lifecycle: pending → scheduled → dispatched → in_transit → delivered/failed
  - APIs: Create shipment, update status, track delivery progress
  - Decoupled from Warehouse via primitive IDs (warehouse_id)
  - Triggered by Order events (async/REST), manages physical movement of goods

### 3. 📦 Install Dependencies

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. ⚙️ Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
