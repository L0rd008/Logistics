# Route Optimizer Module

## Overview

The **Route Optimizer** module is a Django app engineered to compute optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles tasked with deliveries and/or pickups across a designated set of locations. It is built to handle various real-world complexities and operational constraints, including:

*   **Vehicle Constraints**: Accommodates vehicle capacities, ensuring that loads do not exceed limits.
*   **Time Constraints**: Optionally factors in time windows for deliveries and service operations at specific locations.
*   **Real-world Conditions**: Can incorporate traffic data to provide more realistic route plans. External APIs or pre-calculated data can be used for this.
*   **Cost Optimization**: Aims to minimize overall operational costs, which can include travel distance, fixed vehicle costs, and potentially other factors.
*   **Data Source Flexibility**: Supports distance and time calculations through local methods (e.g., Haversine formula for straight-line distances) or by integrating with external APIs (such as the Google Maps Distance Matrix API) for more precise, real-world data.
*   **Dynamic Adjustments**: Features capabilities for dynamic rerouting of vehicles in response to real-time events, such as emergent traffic congestion, service delays at locations, or unexpected roadblocks.

The module is architecturally divided into several key directories:
*   `core/`: Contains fundamental algorithms, core data type definitions (DTOs), and essential constants.
*   `services/`: Houses service classes that orchestrate complex business logic and workflows.
*   `api/`: Manages external communication via RESTful APIs, including request handling, serialization, and response formulation.
*   `utils/`: Provides miscellaneous helper functions and utilities.
It also includes standard Django components like `models.py` for data persistence (e.g., caching), `settings.py` for configurations, and `apps.py` for app-specific Django settings.

## File-by-File Functionality Breakdown

### `route_optimizer/admin.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\admin.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\admin.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   This file is intended for registering Django models with the Django admin interface.
    *   Currently, it is empty, meaning no models from the `route_optimizer` app are explicitly registered for management via the admin panel.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   If models like `DistanceMatrixCache` need to be inspected or managed via the Django admin, they would be registered here.

### `route_optimizer/api/serializers.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\api\serializers.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\api\serializers.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers for validating and converting data between API request/response formats and the internal Python/Django data structures (primarily DTOs from `core/types_1.py` and dataclasses from `models.py`).
    *   Key serializers include:
        *   `LocationSerializer`, `VehicleSerializer`, `DeliverySerializer`: For handling the primary input entities. Define expected structure and validation for location, vehicle, and delivery objects.
        *   `RouteOptimizationRequestSerializer`: Validates the input payload for the main optimization endpoint, including lists of locations, vehicles, deliveries, and flags like `consider_traffic` and `consider_time_windows`.
        *   `ReroutingRequestSerializer`: Validates the input payload for rerouting requests, including current routes and event-specific data (traffic, delays, roadblocks). Handles conditional fields based on `reroute_type`.
        *   `TrafficDataSerializer`: Validates traffic data input, supporting formats like lists of location ID pairs with factors or a dictionary of segments.
        *   `RouteSegmentSerializer`, `VehicleRouteSerializer`: Structure parts of the detailed route output.
        *   `StatisticsSerializer`, `ReroutingInfoSerializer`: For additional metadata in responses.
        *   `OptimizationResultSerializer`: A base or internal serializer for the `OptimizationResult` DTO. Includes a `validate` method calling `validate_optimization_result` from `core/types_1.py`.
        *   `RouteOptimizationResponseSerializer`: Defines the structure of the final successful response for optimization and rerouting endpoints, mapping fields from the internal `OptimizationResult` DTO (e.g., `detailed_routes` from DTO to `routes` in response for client clarity).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Data Validation**: Serializers are the first line of defense for ensuring incoming API data is correct and complete.
    *   **DTO Mapping**: Careful mapping between serializer fields and `OptimizationResult` DTO attributes is crucial, especially for nested structures like `detailed_routes`.
    *   **Clarity in API Response**: The `RouteOptimizationResponseSerializer` aims to provide a clear and usable structure for API clients.
    *   **Conditional Fields**: `ReroutingRequestSerializer`'s `validate` method contains logic for conditional fields based on `reroute_type`, though it's currently permissive for missing conditional data.

### `route_optimizer/api/urls.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\api\urls.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\api\urls.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines the URL patterns for the `route_optimizer` API endpoints.
    *   Maps URLs to the corresponding API views in `api/views.py`.
    *   Includes:
        *   `/health/`: For a health check of the service ([`health_check`](file:///M:\Documents\B-Airways\Logistics\route_optimizer\api\views.py) view).
        *   `/optimize/`: For initiating new route optimizations ([`OptimizeRoutesView`](file:///M:\Documents\B-Airways\Logistics\route_optimizer\api\views.py)).
        *   `/reroute/`: For dynamic vehicle rerouting ([`RerouteView`](file:///M:\Documents\B-Airways\Logistics\route_optimizer\api\views.py)).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   `app_name` is set to `'route_optimizer'`, allowing namespaced URL reversing.
    *   Uses `name` attributes for URL patterns (e.g., `optimize_routes_create`, `reroute_vehicles_update`, `health_check_get`) which match `operation_id` in Swagger documentation for easier API client generation and referencing.

### `route_optimizer/api/views.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\api\views.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\api\views.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Contains the API view logic that handles HTTP requests, interacts with services, and formulates HTTP responses.
    *   **`OptimizeRoutesView(APIView)`**:
        *   Handles `POST` requests to the `/optimize/` endpoint.
        *   Uses `RouteOptimizationRequestSerializer` to validate input.
        *   Instantiates DTOs (`Location`, `Vehicle`, `Delivery`) from validated data.
        *   Calls `OptimizationService.optimize_routes()` to perform the optimization.
        *   Handles conversion of different `traffic_data` input formats (`location_pairs` or `segments`) to the index-based format expected by `OptimizationService`.
        *   Maps the resulting `OptimizationResult` DTO to the `RouteOptimizationResponseSerializer` for the HTTP response.
        *   Includes `swagger_auto_schema` for API documentation generation.
        *   Returns HTTP 400 for service-level errors or HTTP 500 for unexpected exceptions.
    *   **`RerouteView(APIView)`**:
        *   Handles `POST` requests to the `/reroute/` endpoint.
        *   Uses `ReroutingRequestSerializer` for input validation.
        *   Instantiates DTOs and converts `current_routes` JSON to `OptimizationResult` DTO using `OptimizationResult.from_dict()`.
        *   Calls appropriate methods on `ReroutingService` (e.g., `reroute_for_traffic`, `reroute_for_delay`, `reroute_for_roadblock`) based on `reroute_type`.
        *   Maps the `OptimizationResult` DTO from the rerouting service to `RouteOptimizationResponseSerializer`.
    *   **`health_check(request)`** (Function-based view):
        *   Handles `GET` requests to `/health/`. Returns a simple `{"status": "healthy"}` JSON response.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Error Handling**: Views include `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions from service layers or serialization, returning appropriate HTTP 500 or 400 responses.
    *   **DTO Conversion**: A key responsibility is converting serialized request data into the DTOs/dataclasses used by the service layer and converting service DTO results back into serializable dictionaries for the response.
    *   **Logging**: Implements logging for errors and key events.
    *   **Status Code Logic**: The views determine the HTTP response status code (200 OK or 400 Bad Request) based on the `status` field of the `OptimizationResult` DTO returned by the service layer.

### `route_optimizer/apps.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\apps.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\apps.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Standard Django app configuration file.
    *   Defines the `RouteOptimizerConfig` class, inheriting from `AppConfig`.
    *   Sets `default_auto_field`, `name` ('route_optimizer'), and `verbose_name` ('Route Optimization Service') for the app.
    *   Includes a `ready()` method, which can be used for app initialization tasks (e.g., importing signals), though it's currently empty.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   Essential for Django to recognize and manage the `route_optimizer` application.

### `route_optimizer/core/constants.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\core\constants.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\core\constants.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines various global constants used throughout the optimization process.
    *   Includes numerical scaling factors (e.g., `DISTANCE_SCALING_FACTOR`, `CAPACITY_SCALING_FACTOR`, `TIME_SCALING_FACTOR`) which are essential for OR-Tools to work correctly with integer arithmetic.
    *   Specifies safety bounds for distance and time values (e.g., `MAX_SAFE_DISTANCE`, `MAX_SAFE_TIME`) to prevent errors and handle edge cases.
    *   Default values for settings like delivery priority (`DEFAULT_DELIVERY_PRIORITY`, `PRIORITY_NORMAL`, `PRIORITY_HIGH`, etc.) are also defined here.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Consistency is Key**: It is crucial that these constants, especially scaling factors and safety bounds like `MAX_SAFE_DISTANCE`, are used and understood consistently across all modules and their corresponding tests. Mismatches can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    *   **Scaling Factor Impact**: The choice of scaling factors directly influences the precision of calculations and the behavior of the OR-Tools solver. These may need tuning based on the typical range and magnitude of input data.
    *   Constants like `MAX_ROUTE_DURATION_UNSCALED` and `COST_COEFFICIENT_FOR_LOAD_BALANCE` (related to solver behavior) are defined directly within `ortools_optimizer.py` but are conceptually similar to the constants here.

### `route_optimizer/core/dijkstra.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\core\dijkstra.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\core\dijkstra.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Provides an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a graph.
    *   The `DijkstraPathFinder` class offers:
        *   `calculate_shortest_path(graph, start, end)`: Finds the shortest path and distance between a single pair of start and end nodes.
        *   `calculate_all_shortest_paths(graph, nodes)`: Calculates shortest paths between all specified pairs of nodes within the graph.
        *   `_validate_non_negative_weights(graph)`: An internal method to ensure that the graph does not contain negative edge weights, as standard Dijkstra's algorithm cannot handle them correctly.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Negative Weights**: Explicitly checks for and raises a `ValueError` if negative edge weights are detected. If scenarios with negative weights are required, an alternative algorithm like Bellman-Ford would be necessary.
    *   **Graph Representation**: Expects the input graph to be represented as a dictionary of dictionaries (an adjacency list format where `graph[node1][node2]` gives the weight of the edge from `node1` to `node2`).
    *   **Use Case**: This pathfinder is primarily used by the `PathAnnotator` service ([`Logistics\route_optimizer\services\path_annotation_service.py`](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\path_annotation_service.py)) to generate detailed path segments for routes when external APIs are not being used for this purpose.

### `route_optimizer/core/distance_matrix.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\core\distance_matrix.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\core\distance_matrix.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   The `DistanceMatrixBuilder` class is responsible for creating, caching, and managing distance and time matrices, which are fundamental inputs for VRP solvers.
    *   **`create_distance_matrix(...)`**: Main method for matrix generation.
        *   Supports Haversine formula (default) or Euclidean for local distance calculations.
        *   Can integrate with Google Maps Distance Matrix API if `use_api=True` and an `api_key` is available, falling back to Haversine on failure.
        *   Returns a tuple: `(distance_matrix_km, time_matrix_minutes_optional, location_ids_list)`.
    *   **API Interaction & Caching**:
        *   `create_distance_matrix_from_api(...)`: Manages Google Maps API requests, including retry logic (`_send_request_with_retry`) and caching results using the `DistanceMatrixCache` Django model to minimize API calls.
        *   `_process_api_response(...)`: Parses Google Maps API JSON responses, standardizing distances to kilometers and times to minutes.
    *   **Matrix Manipulation**:
        *   `_sanitize_distance_matrix(matrix)`: Cleans matrices by replacing `NaN`, `inf`, and negative values with appropriate fallbacks (e.g., `MAX_SAFE_DISTANCE` or 0), critical for solver stability.
        *   `add_traffic_factors(matrix, traffic_data)` and `_apply_traffic_safely(matrix, traffic_data)`: Apply traffic adjustment factors to time matrices (or distance matrices if used as cost proxies), with safety checks to cap extreme factor values (e.g., factor < 1.0 becomes 1.0, very large factors capped at `max_safe_factor` which is 5.0).
        *   `distance_matrix_to_graph(matrix, location_ids)`: Converts a numerical distance matrix into a dictionary-based graph representation suitable for algorithms like Dijkstra's.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **API Key**: Relies on `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` from `route_optimizer.settings` when API usage is enabled.
    *   **Fallback Behavior**: Gracefully falls back to local calculation methods (typically Haversine) if API calls fail or are not configured.
    *   **Units**: Standardizes distances to kilometers and times to minutes for consistency.
    *   **Data Integrity**: Matrix sanitization is crucial for providing clean, numerically stable input to VRP solvers.

### `route_optimizer/core/ortools_optimizer.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\core\ortools_optimizer.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\core\ortools_optimizer.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Encapsulates the logic for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) using Google's OR-Tools library.
    *   The `ORToolsVRPSolver` class provides methods to solve VRP variants:
        *   `solve(...)`: Solves the basic Capacitated VRP (CVRP), primarily considering vehicle capacities and minimizing total distance/cost. It sets up `RoutingIndexManager`, `RoutingModel`, defines distance and demand callbacks, adds capacity dimensions, configures search parameters (e.g., `PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC`, `GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH`, time limit), and processes the solution into an `OptimizationResult` DTO. Includes logic for load balancing based on route distance.
        *   `solve_with_time_windows(...)`: Solves the VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW), respecting delivery time constraints for locations. Similar setup but adds a time dimension using a time callback that considers travel time, service time, and waiting time. Also processes the solution into an `OptimizationResult` DTO, including estimated arrival times. Includes load balancing based on the 'Time' dimension.
    *   **Constraint Handling**: Manages vehicle capacities, start/end locations, number of vehicles, and time windows.
    *   **Callbacks**: Defines and registers essential distance, demand, and time callbacks for OR-Tools.
    *   **Solution Processing**: Interprets OR-Tools solutions into a standardized `OptimizationResult` DTO.
    *   **Load Balancing**: Uses `SetGlobalSpanCostCoefficient` to encourage even distribution of workload (either total distance or total time) among vehicles. `COST_COEFFICIENT_FOR_LOAD_BALANCE` (defined locally) tunes this.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Integer Scaling**: OR-Tools requires integer inputs. This solver uses scaling factors (`DISTANCE_SCALING_FACTOR`, `TIME_SCALING_FACTOR`, `CAPACITY_SCALING_FACTOR`) from `constants.py`.
    *   **Depot Index**: The `depot_index` is a fundamental parameter.
    *   **Time Limits**: Solver runtime is controlled by `time_limit_seconds`.
    *   **Empty Problem Handling**: If no deliveries are provided, it generates simple depot-to-depot routes.
    *   **Solver Constants**: Defines local constants like `MAX_ROUTE_DURATION_UNSCALED`, `MAX_ROUTE_DISTANCE_UNSCALED` for dimension capacities.

### `route_optimizer/core/types_1.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\core\types_1.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\core\types_1.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines core Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) using Python's `dataclass` feature for standardized and type-safe data handling.
    *   Key DTOs include:
        *   `Location`: Represents a geographical point (coordinates, depot status, time windows, service time).
        *   `OptimizationResult`: Encapsulates optimization/rerouting output (status, routes, distance/cost, assignments, detailed routes, statistics). Includes `from_dict` static method for reconstruction.
        *   `RouteSegment`: Details a path segment (from/to locations, path, distance, time).
        *   `DetailedRoute`: Comprehensive vehicle route description (vehicle ID, stops, segments, distance/time, capacity use, arrival times).
        *   `ReroutingInfo`: Metadata for rerouting operations (reason, traffic factors, completed/remaining deliveries, etc.).
    *   `validate_optimization_result(result: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`: Validates the structure of an `OptimizationResult` dictionary.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Standardization & Type Safety**: DTOs are key for consistent data handling and code quality.
    *   **Data Integrity**: `validate_optimization_result` helps ensure result correctness.
    *   **Mutability**: Dataclasses are mutable by default.
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization**: While DTOs structure data, actual JSON conversion is handled by serializers or custom logic (e.g., `OptimizationResult.from_dict`).

### `route_optimizer/migrations/0001_initial.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\migrations\0001_initial.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\migrations\0001_initial.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   The initial Django database migration file for the `route_optimizer` app.
    *   Defines the database schema for the `DistanceMatrixCache` model, including table creation, fields, and indexes.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   Auto-generated by Django's `makemigrations` command based on `models.py`. It should not typically be edited manually.
    *   Ensures database schema matches model definitions.

### `route_optimizer/models.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\models.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\models.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines data models for the application.
    *   **Dataclasses (not Django models, but defined here for co-location of data structures)**:
        *   `Vehicle`: Represents a vehicle with `id`, `capacity`, `start_location_id`, `end_location_id`, `cost_per_km`, `fixed_cost`, `max_distance`, `max_stops`, `available`, `skills`.
        *   `Delivery`: Represents a delivery/pickup task with `id`, `location_id`, `demand`, `priority`, `required_skills`, `is_pickup`.
    *   **Django Model**:
        *   `DistanceMatrixCache(models.Model)`: Used to store cached distance and time matrices generated by `DistanceMatrixBuilder`. Fields: `cache_key` (unique), `matrix_data` (JSON), `location_ids` (JSON), `time_matrix_data` (JSON, nullable), `created_at`. Includes database indexes for `cache_key` and `created_at`.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   `DistanceMatrixCache` is the only Django model here for database persistence.
    *   The dataclasses `Vehicle` and `Delivery` are used as structured in-memory data containers, primarily for inputs to services and solvers.

### `route_optimizer/README.md` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\README.md](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\README.md))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   This file itself. Provides a comprehensive overview of the `route_optimizer` module, its purpose, core components, and a file-by-file breakdown of functionality and important considerations.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   Serves as the primary human-readable guide to understanding the module's architecture and interactions. It should be kept up-to-date with codebase evolution.

### `route_optimizer/services/depot_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\depot_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\depot_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   The `DepotService` class provides utility functions for identifying and managing depot locations.
    *   `get_nearest_depot(locations)`: Returns the first location marked as `is_depot=True`. If none, defaults to the first location in the list.
    *   `find_depot_index(locations)`: Returns the numerical index of the depot location. Defaults to index 0 if no explicit depot is found.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Depot Assumption**: Current logic is simple, assuming a single primary depot or picking the first one encountered. More complex multi-depot scenarios would need enhanced logic.
    *   **Fallback Behavior**: Defaulting to the first location as a depot ensures the VRP solver has a required start/end point.

### `route_optimizer/services/external_data_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\external_data_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\external_data_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   The `ExternalDataService` is designed to fetch and process external data affecting route optimization (e.g., traffic, weather, roadblocks).
    *   Defines methods like `get_traffic_data`, `get_weather_data`, `get_roadblock_data`.
    *   Includes `_make_api_request` for API calls with retries.
    *   Provides mock data (e.g., `_mock_traffic_data`) if `use_mocks` is true or if API keys/integrations are absent.
    *   Helper `combine_traffic_and_weather` merges factors from different sources.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Mock vs. Real Data**: Mock data needs replacement with actual API integrations for production.
    *   **API Key Management**: Real API usage would necessitate proper API key handling (e.g., from settings).
    *   **Fallback to Mock**: Ensures some data is always available if API calls fail or are not configured.

### `route_optimizer/services/optimization_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\optimization_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\optimization_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   The `OptimizationService` is the main orchestrator for route optimization, linking various `core` and `services` components.
    *   **`optimize_routes(...)`**: Primary public method.
        1.  **Input Validation (`_validate_inputs`)**: Checks locations, vehicles, deliveries.
        2.  **Caching (`_generate_cache_key`)**: Uses Django's cache framework for `OptimizationResult`.
        3.  **Distance Matrix Creation**: Uses `DistanceMatrixBuilder`, deciding local vs. API based on `use_api` flag and settings.
        4.  **Traffic Data Application**: If `consider_traffic` and `traffic_data` are provided, applies factors using `DistanceMatrixBuilder.add_traffic_factors`.
        5.  **Depot Identification**: Uses `DepotService`.
        6.  **VRP Solving**: Invokes `ORToolsVRPSolver.solve()` or `solve_with_time_windows()` based on `consider_time_windows`.
        7.  **Result Enrichment**:
            *   `_add_detailed_paths(...)`: Populates `detailed_routes`. If API was used for matrix, tries `TrafficService.create_road_graph` for path details; otherwise, uses `PathAnnotator` with the computed distance matrix.
            *   `_add_summary_statistics(...)`: Calls `RouteStatsService.add_statistics`.
    *   **Initialization**: Allows injection of VRP solver and pathfinder (defaults to `ORToolsVRPSolver` and `DijkstraPathFinder`).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Central Orchestration**: Main entry point for optimization.
    *   **Error Handling**: General `try-except` in `optimize_routes` returns `OptimizationResult` with `status='error'`.
    *   **API Usage Control**: Governed by `use_api` parameter and `USE_API_BY_DEFAULT` setting.
    *   **DTO Consistency**: Ensures final output is a consistent `OptimizationResult` DTO.
    *   **Backward Compatibility**: Some internal methods handle both `dict` and `OptimizationResult` DTOs.

### `route_optimizer/services/path_annotation_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\path_annotation_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\path_annotation_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   `PathAnnotator` class enriches optimization results with detailed segment-by-segment path information, mainly when external APIs aren't providing this.
    *   **`annotate(result, graph_or_matrix)`**: Main method. Iterates routes in `result`. For each segment, uses an injected `path_finder` (e.g., `DijkstraPathFinder`) to calculate the shortest path using the `graph_or_matrix` input. Populates `detailed_routes` with these segments.
    *   Handles `dict` or `OptimizationResult` DTO inputs.
    *   **`_add_summary_statistics(result, vehicles)`**: Helper that ensures basic `detailed_routes` structure and calls `RouteStatsService.add_statistics`. (Note: `OptimizationService` also calls `RouteStatsService` separately, this might be for specific use cases or review).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Path Finder Dependency**: Detailed path quality depends on the `path_finder` and input graph/matrix realism.
    *   **Error Handling**: Logs path calculation errors and adds placeholder segments to avoid halting.
    *   **Data Structure Management**: Manages `dict` vs. `OptimizationResult` DTOs for `detailed_routes`.

### `route_optimizer/services/rerouting_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\rerouting_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\rerouting_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   `ReroutingService` enables dynamic adjustments to existing route plans due to real-time events. Relies on `OptimizationService` for re-optimization.
    *   **Key Methods**:
        *   `reroute_for_traffic(...)`: Adjusts routes based on new `traffic_data`.
        *   `reroute_for_delay(...)`: Modifies routes due to service delays by updating `Location.service_time` and re-optimizing (usually with time windows).
        *   `reroute_for_roadblock(...)`: Handles roadblocks by effectively making segments impassable (e.g., infinite cost/distance via `traffic_data`) and re-optimizing.
    *   **Helper Methods**:
        *   `_get_remaining_deliveries(...)`: Filters original deliveries to find pending ones.
        *   `_update_vehicle_positions(...)`: Simplified estimation of current vehicle locations based on last completed delivery in `current_routes`. Updates `Vehicle.start_location_id`.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **State Management**: Accurate `completed_deliveries` and vehicle positions are critical. `_update_vehicle_positions` is a simplified placeholder.
    *   **Re-Optimization Cost**: Rerouting triggers a new, potentially intensive VRP solve.
    *   **Input DTOs**: Expects `current_routes` as `OptimizationResult` DTO and other inputs as lists of relevant DTOs/dataclasses.
    *   **ReroutingInfo**: Populates `rerouting_info` in the `OptimizationResult.statistics` DTO for context.

### `route_optimizer/services/route_stats_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\route_stats_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\route_stats_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   `RouteStatsService` calculates and adds summary statistics to an optimization result.
    *   **`add_statistics(result, vehicles)`** (static method):
        *   Calculates costs per vehicle (fixed + variable based on `Vehicle.cost_per_km` and segment distances from `detailed_routes`) and total solution cost.
        *   Aggregates overall stats: total stops, total distance, vehicles used, deliveries assigned.
        *   Handles `result` as a dictionary or `OptimizationResult` DTO.
        *   If `detailed_routes` are absent but simple `routes` exist, it creates basic `detailed_routes` structure for partial stats.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Cost Calculation Dependency**: Accurate costs need `detailed_routes` populated with segment distances.
    *   **In-place Modification**: Modifies the input `result` object by adding/updating `statistics`, `total_cost`, and potentially `detailed_routes`.
    *   **Vehicle Data**: Requires the list of `Vehicle` objects for cost parameters.

### `route_optimizer/services/traffic_service.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\traffic_service.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\traffic_service.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   `TrafficService` provides traffic-related information and utilities.
    *   **`apply_traffic_factors(matrix, traffic_data)`** (static): Wraps `DistanceMatrixBuilder.add_traffic_factors`.
    *   **`create_road_graph(locations)`**:
        *   If an `api_key` is available (from service init or settings), attempts to use Google Maps API (via `DistanceMatrixBuilder.create_distance_matrix_from_api`) for real road distances/times to build the graph.
        *   Falls back to Haversine distances (`_calculate_distance_haversine`) if API fails or no key.
        *   Returns graph as `{'nodes': {}, 'edges': {from_node: {to_node: {'distance': km, 'time': secs}}}}`.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **API for Road Graph**: `create_road_graph` is key for `OptimizationService` (with `use_api=True`) to get detailed paths from a realistic road network.
    *   **Fallback**: Ensures functionality via Haversine if API access is unavailable.

### `route_optimizer/services/vrp_solver.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\services\vrp_solver.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\services\vrp_solver.py))
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Contains a standalone `solve_with_time_windows(...)` function. This function's core logic for setting up and solving a VRPTW with OR-Tools is very similar to the `ORToolsVRPSolver.solve_with_time_windows` method found in `core/ortools_optimizer.py`.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Potential Redundancy**: Its existence suggests a possible area for refactoring. The primary and authoritative OR-Tools solver implementation should ideally be consolidated within the `ORToolsVRPSolver` class in `core/ortools_optimizer.py`.
    *   This standalone function might be legacy code or intended for a specialized, isolated use case. A review of its current usage is recommended to determine if it can be deprecated or merged.

### `route_optimizer/settings.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\settings.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\settings.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Manages application-specific configurations for the `route_optimizer` module.
    *   Uses `load_env_from_file` (from `utils/env_loader.py`) to load environment variables from a file (e.g., `env_var.env` or `.env`), primarily for local development.
    *   Defines key settings:
        *   `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_URL`.
        *   `USE_API_BY_DEFAULT`: Boolean determining default API usage.
        *   API request parameters: `MAX_RETRIES`, `BACKOFF_FACTOR`, `RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`.
        *   Caching: `CACHE_EXPIRY_DAYS`, `OPTIMIZATION_RESULT_CACHE_TIMEOUT`.
        *   `TESTING`: Flag to alter behavior during tests (e.g., disable external calls).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Environment Variables**: Crucial for API keys and sensitive data. The `.env` file should be in `.gitignore`.
    *   **Centralized Configuration**: Provides a single place for managing operational parameters.
    *   **Test vs. Production Settings**: The `TESTING` flag allows different configurations for test runs (see `tests/test_settings.py`).

### `route_optimizer/utils/env_loader.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\utils\env_loader.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\utils\env_loader.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Provides `load_env_from_file(file_path)` utility.
    *   Reads a `.env` file (or similar) containing `KEY=VALUE` pairs, parses them, and loads them into `os.environ`.
    *   Skips empty lines and comments (`#`).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Local Development**: Simplifies setting environment variables locally without system-wide changes.
    *   **Error Handling**: Logs warnings for missing files and errors during parsing/setting variables.
    *   **Security**: The `.env` file with sensitive data must be secured and gitignored.

### `route_optimizer/utils/helpers.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\utils\helpers.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\utils\helpers.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   A collection of miscellaneous, general-purpose utility functions.
    *   Examples:
        *   Time conversions (`convert_minutes_to_time_str`, `format_duration`).
        *   Haversine distance calculation.
        *   Route formatting for display (`format_route_for_display`).
        *   Applying external factors to matrices (`apply_external_factors`).
        *   Graph utilities (`detect_isolated_nodes`).
        *   Safe JSON serialization (`safe_json_dumps` handling `datetime`, `numpy` types, etc.).
*   **Important Points**:
    *   **Redundancy Review**: Some functions might overlap with methods in specialized classes (e.g., Haversine in `DistanceMatrixBuilder`). Consider refactoring for a single source of truth.
    *   **Generic Utilities**: Small, focused helpers for common tasks.

### `route_optimizer/views.py` (root level) ([Logistics\route_optimizer\views.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\views.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Standard Django views file for the `route_optimizer` app, typically for HTML template rendering.
    *   Currently empty, as all view logic is API-focused and located in `route_optimizer/api/views.py`.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   Would be used if the app served traditional Django web pages.

### `route_optimizer/__init__.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\__init__.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\__init__.py))

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Standard Python package initializer for the `route_optimizer` directory, making it a Python package.
    *   Contains a docstring and a `__version__` attribute.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   Can control package exports or execute package-level initialization code if needed.

## Testing (`route_optimizer/tests/`)

The `tests/` directory is critical for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the `route_optimizer` module.

*   **Structure**:
    *   Organized to mirror the main application structure (e.g., `tests/api/`, `tests/core/`, `tests/services/`).
*   **Key Files**:
    *   Individual test files for serializers (`test_serializers.py`), views (`test_views.py`), core components (`test_dijkstra.py`, `test_distance_matrix.py`, `test_ortools_optimizer.py`, `test_types.py`), services (e.g., `test_optimization_service.py`), models (`test_models.py`), and utilities (`test_helpers.py`).
*   **Configuration**:
    *   `conftest.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\conftest.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\conftest.py)): Pytest configuration file. Often used for setting up fixtures and plugins. Ensures the Django environment is correctly initialized for tests using settings from `test_settings.py`.
    *   `test_settings.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\test_settings.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\test_settings.py)): Defines Django settings specifically tailored for the testing environment. This typically includes using an in-memory SQLite database for speed, dummy API keys, disabling unnecessary middleware or apps, and configuring caches to be in-memory or dummy. It ensures tests are isolated and don't rely on external services or development configurations.
    *   `__init__.py` ([Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\__init__.py](file:///Logistics\route_optimizer\tests\__init__.py)): Ensures the `tests` directory is treated as a Python package and can also be used to run Django setup (`django.setup()`) if `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is configured, ensuring test settings are applied early.
*   **Important Points**:
    *   A comprehensive test suite covering both unit tests (for individual functions/classes) and integration tests (for interactions between components) is essential.
    *   Tests should be independent and repeatable.
    *   Using mocks effectively (e.g., `unittest.mock.patch`) is crucial for isolating components and simulating external dependencies like API calls or complex service responses.
    *   The test-specific settings in `test_settings.py` are vital for creating a controlled and efficient testing environment.
